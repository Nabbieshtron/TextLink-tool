# TextLink-tool
Allows users to write simple documents and create a link for specific frazes
In the top-right corner the listbox is a link manager, below is a link exception manager and below is a way to add,edit exceptions
How exceptions works, for example you have created a link "talk" and want to add exception "talking", you probably wonder why to do this.
When user opens a title or a link, tool automaticly checks if in text exist a phrase to add to link manager and adds exceptions that is linked to the link
Currently this tool creates a folder saves in file (main.py) location, in that folder there will be 2 files (_titles_.txt, _exceptions_.txt), and every link that will be opened and not empty.
